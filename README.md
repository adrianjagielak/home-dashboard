# home-dashboard
A modular smart home data collection and control system. This project includes services for collecting, aggregating, and visualizing time-series data (e.g., energy usage, environmental stats) and decision-making for smart device actions.

Initially designed to optimize energy usage in my personal household under a dynamic pricing plan ([[1]](https://energy.instrat.pl/ceny/energia-rdn-godzinowe/), [[2]](https://www.tge.pl/energia-elektryczna-rdn)), this project has evolved into a general-purpose home automation dashboard.
